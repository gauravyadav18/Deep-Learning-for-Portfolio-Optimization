# Deep-Learning-for-Portfolio-Optimization

This study presents a novel prediction-based portfolio optimization framework called AE+LSTM+OMEGA, which integrates deep learning techniques with robust optimization strategies to enhance investment performance. The approach combines an Autoencoder (AE) for feature extraction, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network for return forecasting, and a Worst-Case Omega model for portfolio allocation
